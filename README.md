# 💊 Animed – AI-Powered Medicine Finder for Rancher 🐄🤖
Animed is a mobile application developed to assist ranch workers in accurately identifying animal medicines using image recognition. The app leverages AI to detect packaging and logos through a camera-based interface. Once identified, it provides essential details about the medicine, including proper dosage and usage instructions—empowering ranchers with critical knowledge for animal care.

Built with Kotlin, Android Studio, and TensorFlow Lite, the app runs entirely offline, requiring no database or internet connection. Its AI model was trained using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow, ensuring accurate recognition across a wide range of livestock medications. Supporting multiple animal types, Animed bridges the gap between veterinary knowledge and ranch operations in a user-friendly format.

Developed for the CPF Young Software Developer Program, this project showcases our expertise in on-device AI and mobile development. As Project Manager and Researcher, I led the design and dataset curation.
